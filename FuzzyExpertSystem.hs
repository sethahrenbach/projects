-- I try to implement some fuzzy logic operators in this module, to 
-- automatically choose an appropriate wardrobe for you.
-- The current prototype can choose clothing along two dimensions: 1) light/heavy, 2) fanciness.
-- (1) is based on temperature and humidity predicates.
-- (2) is based on occasion predicates.
-- Much of the underlying framework comes from Gary Meehan and Mike Joy "Animated Fuzzy Logic" Journal of Functional Programming, 1993.
-- I introduce some extensions to the logic, like Yager operations, and alternative operator definitions.
-- The application to this specific decision problem is my original work. 
-- I denote all of my original code with notes to that effect.
